 * Opens Jumper.exchange (LI.FI's hosted bridge UI) in a new tab with the
 * destination chain (Polygon), token (USDC.e), and recipient address
 * pre-selected in the URL. Hunch stays open in the original tab.
 *
 * Why a new-tab hand-off rather than an in-page iframe or the @lifi/widget
 * npm package:
 *   - All mainstream bridge UIs (Jumper, Squid, Across, Stargate) ship strict
 *     `frame-ancestors` CSPs that block third-party iframing — universal
 *     clickjacking protection. An iframe would load blank.
 *   - @lifi/widget v3 hard-imports Solana, Sui, and Bitcoin wallet stacks at
 *     module-load time, adding ~500 KB and dozens of peer-deps for a feature
 *     that's secondary to the screener.
 *   - The new-tab hand-off costs zero bundle, requires no setup, and lands
 *     the user on a familiar audited UI for the actual fund movement. The
 *     destination is pre-filled so a careless paste-and-forget can't send
 *     funds to the wrong account.
 *
 * If we ever want a truly embedded experience, the right path is option C
 * from the bridge spec: a Hunch-controlled UI built on top of LI.FI's SDK
 * (not the widget) — that's a half-day build that needs careful testing
 * with real funds across chains.
